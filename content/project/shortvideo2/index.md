title: Lost Reminiscing
summary: Tribute to Kar-Wai Wong | Hong Kong Style Emotional Literary Short Film

This short film has strong characteristics of Guang Fu Culture, and I used my native Cantonese for the dubbing to restore as much as possible the characteristics of Kar-Wai Wong's audio-visual techniques, which is my first ethnographic practice in the direction of short videos.
This short film was created out of my feelings after watching a film directed by Kar-Wai Wong called Chungking Express due to a breakup. It records my psychological journey and feelings of a breakup, and at the end of the short film, I try to define the failure of the relationship, tried to persuade myself, gave myself the psychological implication that he was not suitable for me, and tried to draw a seemingly happy ending.
