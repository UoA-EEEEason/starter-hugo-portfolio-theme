title: 【Modelling and Empirical Study of Fear Appeals to Parents for Family Health Information Dissemination and Prevention - Based on an Extended Parallel Process Model】
summary: This is a quantitative analysis paper in the direction of health communication, a group coursework in a course called Psychology of Persuasion, and I was the second author in the writing of this article. In this paper, we use the extended parallel process model (EPPM) as a theoretical cornerstone to investigate whether fearful appeals affect parents' behaviour in disseminating family health information and prevention.
