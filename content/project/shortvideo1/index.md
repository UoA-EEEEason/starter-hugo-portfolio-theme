title: Who stole my suicide plan?
summary: Tribute to Wes Anderson | Wes Anderson-style aesthetic girly retro short film
Based on the MBTI 16 personalities test, I tested as an INFJ, and one of the traits of this personality is that emotional burnout is a normalised state of mine. So this video was inspired by the fact that I occasionally have negative thoughts about suicide.
By confronting my negative emotions and thoughts, I hope to convey to all those who read this piece that although living is also a form of enduring, one lives in this world surrounded by love more than anything else, and that one receives love as well as gives it. No one can harm anyone, including himself, for his own selfish purposes. The law of the jungle does not apply to human society, and to apply the law of the jungle rigidly to human beings themselves is an irony and contempt for human values.
