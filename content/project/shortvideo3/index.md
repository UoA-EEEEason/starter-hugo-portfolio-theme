title: I Like For You To Be Still
summary: Tribute to Neruda | Original Emotional Poetry Short Film

This work is inspired by the poem "I Like For You To Be Still" by Chilean poet Pablo Neruda.
In the short film, in order to better establish the correlation and commonality between the content of the poem and the emotion of the subject "I", I focus on the relative relationship between motion and stillness, such as using the waves as a metaphor for the complexity of a woman's emotion, etc. At the same time, I added the voice-over of the poem in the post-editing, thus enhancing the sense of rhythm and tempo. 
In this work, I still want to express myself, i.e. I yearn for freedom, I hate parting, I am intermittently nostalgic for the past, and I feel as if the end of my emotions is doorslam.
